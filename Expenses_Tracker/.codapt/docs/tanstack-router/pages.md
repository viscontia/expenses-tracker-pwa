TanStack Router supports a number of powerful routing concepts that allow you to build complex and dynamic routing systems with ease.

Each of these concepts is useful and powerful, and we'll dive into each of them in the following sections.

## Anatomy of a Route

All other routes, other than the [Root Route](#the-root-route), are configured using the `createFileRoute` function, which provides type safety when using file-based routing:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  component: PostsComponent,
});
```

The `createFileRoute` function takes a single argument, the file-route's path as a string.

## The Root Route

The root route is the top-most route in the entire tree and encapsulates all other routes as children.

- It has no path
- It is **always** matched
- Its `component` is **always** rendered

Even though it doesn't have a path, the root route has access to all of the same functionality as other routes including:

- components
- loaders
- search param validation
- etc.

To create a root route, call the `createRootRoute()` function and export it as the `Route` variable in your route file:

```tsx
// Standard root route
import { createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute();

// Root route with Context
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import type { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export interface MyRouterContext {
  queryClient: QueryClient;
}
export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>();
```

To learn more about Context in TanStack Router, see the [Router Context](../guide/router-context.md) guide.

## Basic Routes

Basic routes match a specific path, for example `/about`, `/settings`, `/settings/notifications` are all basic routes, as they match the path exactly.

Let's take a look at an `/about` route:

```tsx
// about.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/about")({
  component: AboutComponent,
});

function AboutComponent() {
  return <div>About</div>;
}
```

Basic routes are simple and straightforward. They match the path exactly and render the provided component.

## Index Routes

Index routes specifically target their parent route when it is **matched exactly and no child route is matched**.

Let's take a look at an index route for a `/posts` URL:

```tsx
// posts.index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Note the trailing slash, which is used to target index routes
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/")({
  component: PostsIndexComponent,
});

function PostsIndexComponent() {
  return <div>Please select a post!</div>;
}
```

This route will be matched when the URL is `/posts` exactly.

## Dynamic Route Segments

Route path segments that start with a `$` followed by a label are dynamic and capture that section of the URL into the `params` object for use in your application. For example, a pathname of `/posts/123` would match the `/posts/$postId` route, and the `params` object would be `{ postId: '123' }`.

These params are then usable in your route's configuration and components! Let's look at a `posts.$postId.tsx` route:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  // In a loader
  loader: ({ params }) => fetchPost(params.postId),
  // Or in a component
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  // In a component!
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();
  return <div>Post ID: {postId}</div>;
}
```

> ðŸ§  Dynamic segments work at **each** segment of the path. For example, you could have a route with the path of `/posts/$postId/$revisionId` and each `$` segment would be captured into the `params` object.

## Splat / Catch-All Routes

A route with a path of only `$` is called a "splat" route because it _always_ captures _any_ remaining section of the URL pathname from the `$` to the end. The captured pathname is then available in the `params` object under the special `_splat` property.

For example, a route targeting the `files/$` path is a splat route. If the URL pathname is `/files/documents/hello-world`, the `params` object would contain `documents/hello-world` under the special `_splat` property:

```js
{
  '_splat': 'documents/hello-world'
}
```

## Layout Routes

Layout routes are used to wrap child routes with additional components and logic. They are useful for:

- Wrapping child routes with a layout component
- Enforcing a `loader` requirement before displaying any child routes
- Validating and providing search params to child routes
- Providing fallbacks for error components or pending elements to child routes
- Providing shared context to all child routes
- And more!

Let's take a look at an example layout route called `app.tsx`:

```
routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ app.dashboard.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ app.settings.tsx
```

In the tree above, `app.tsx` is a layout route that wraps two child routes, `app.dashboard.tsx` and `app.settings.tsx`.

This tree structure is used to wrap the child routes with a layout component:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/app")({
  component: AppLayoutComponent,
});

function AppLayoutComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>App Layout</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The following table shows which component(s) will be rendered based on the URL:

| URL Path         | Component                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/`              | `<Index>`                |
| `/app/dashboard` | `<AppLayout><Dashboard>` |
| `/app/settings`  | `<AppLayout><Settings>`  |

Since TanStack Router supports mixed flat and directory routes, you can also express your application's routing using layout routes within directories:

```
routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ route.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.tsx
```

In this nested tree, the `app/route.tsx` file is a configuration for the layout route that wraps two child routes, `app/dashboard.tsx` and `app/settings.tsx`.

Layout Routes also let you enforce component and loader logic for Dynamic Route Segments:

```
routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/users/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ $userId/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ route.tsx
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ edit.tsx
```
